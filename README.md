# Onitama 
Onitama is a 2-player board game of size 5x5. 
Each player starts the game with 5 pieces: 4 pawn and a "Master pawn", and with 2 cards, another card is added near the board. 
The goal of the game is to kill the opponent's king, or to reach your opponent's king starting point.

The player can move their pieces according to the 2 cards in front of them, once a move from a card is played, the card is exchanged with the one near the board. 

# AlphaZero

My goal is to implement the AlphaZero algorithm for Onitama; following the amazing paper  
"Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" (silver et al. 2017)
